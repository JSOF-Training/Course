Patch the ELF file "patchme" such that, when it is run, the following output is shown:
"Success: This file is valid"
You may ONLY patch bytes in the .rodata section.
DO NOT patch the .text section.
In this program the .text section will always load to the same address (i.e. it is not a position-independent executable)
Good luck.
