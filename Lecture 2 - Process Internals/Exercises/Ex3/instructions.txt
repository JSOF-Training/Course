patch the executable loader_easier and loader_harder so that they load the shared library loadme.so.

You should patch only the metadata, in the sense that you should not change any of the executable's code.

loader_easier is easier than loader_harder as the names suggest. 

Note: The point of (loader_easer though there is a very simple solution for it, and) loader_harder is to get loadme to load when executing the executable, while leaving the behavior of the executables code the same - If it works, then it's a good solution.
You do not need to read the loader's code for this, several trials and errors in patching should lead you to a solution.
