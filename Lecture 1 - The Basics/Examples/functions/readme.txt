The same file (functions.c) compiled to 32- and 64-bit code
With and without debug symbols

Requirements to compile yourself:
    Linux/WSL with:
        GCC, LD, MAKE
    	The gcc-multilib package to compile 32-bit code
    
Note that to *run* 32-bit executables on 64-bit WSL you'll need quite a few more packages
