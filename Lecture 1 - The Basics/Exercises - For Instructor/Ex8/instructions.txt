Your goal is to patch the executable with minimal changes (minimal changes of bytes possible).
More specifically, a good solution should be a minimal patch that produces the output "Nope", and then another minimal patch (to the just patched executable) that produces the reward output.
Then you should enjoy the reward.

Note: a two byte patch (that is the final executable having 2 different bytes) should be enough.
