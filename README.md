# JSOF Course

In this repository you'll find all the material for our course.

For each of the lectures you'll find:

- Lecture and recitation slides under the folder `Slides`.
- Cheatsheets, extra material and relevant manuals under the folder `References`.
- Examples from the lecture to play around with before starting the exercises under the folder `Examples`.
- The exercises themselves under the folder `Exercises`.
- Solutions to the exercises or material used to create the exercise from which it's trivial to find out the solution under the folder `Exercises - For Instructor`.

We may add more material in the future, see `git log` for details.
