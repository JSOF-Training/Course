Exercise 5: Stack

This program is a bit more complicated.
In addition, the code is located at the beginning of the address space, so now the addresses contain null bytes.

You have two tasks:
1. Make the program output "Congratulations, you win!"
2. Do the same, only now make sure the input you give contains no null bytes.
You may skip directly to the second task.

To test if your input contains null bytes, you can use:
    grep -Pa '\x00' _your_filename_
or:
	grep -Pa '\x00' <(_your_command_)
or whatever you prefer, and then immediately test grep's return value by:
	echo $?
where:
	1 means no null bytes found
	0 means null bytes were found
	

Remember gets() only receives input up to a newline.
Again, there is a secret function that outputs what is required.

The level is not passed if you get a segfault or an illegal instruction.
