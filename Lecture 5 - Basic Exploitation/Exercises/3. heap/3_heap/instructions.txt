Exercise A: Heap

This level uses an old (and unsafe) version of dlmalloc (Doug Lea malloc)
You can read about this implementation online.

This level is passed when the following output is shown:
"that wasn't too bad now, was it?"

The level is not passed if you get a segfault or an illegal instruction.
